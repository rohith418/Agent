## What is 1508583 Standard


It is the International Organization for Standardization standard for systems that exchange electronic transactions initiated by cardholders using payment cards (Credit/Debit) IS0 8583 is an international standard fori financial transaction card originated
interchange messaging. IS0 8583 messages capture rich data which is critical for effective data analytics.
Different systems (POS, Payment Gateway, Acquirer, Network,
Issuer or Processor, etc.,) involved in a card transaction can exchange information
in


IS0 Message is sent/received over
This standard has also evolved over the years to remain updated with newer and safer payment methods. The latest version of this standard is
D TCP protocols
I508583 Message can be ASCII (BCD-Binary Coded Decimal)/EBCDIC
an interoperable manner.
Extended Binary Coded Decimals Interchange Code
called IS0 8583: 2003.
### Card Transaction Journey


All Card transactions will follow the I50 8583 message travels from a source to a destination. For example, when you swipe your card in POS machine, the POS machine initiates an IS0 8583 message that finally reaches the issuer/processor via the acquirer and the
network scheme.
In response, the issuer will initiate another I5O 8583 message (indicating success or failure) to respond to the: POS machine

What do we have in I508583 Message?
#
When we are sending a I508583 message to receiving system, first we need to send length of the complete message (Includes header and body).
In general message header length is 22 bytes, which will have source and destination ids.
Message body is defined below.
If a message body is 150 bytes and header is 22 bytes then
Receiving system also first reads first two bytes as length of message and then
as part
as


of message transmission we will be sending 172
first 2 bytes transmission to receiving system,
Once the full message is received then it devides bytes into header and body.
sCans rest of the bytes stream till all the lenght Of the message is received.
In above example First 22 bytes are header and the rest 150 bytes are message body.

###IS08583
message body is made up of the following components:


" *Message Type Indicator (MTI):""
MTI indicates the purpose of the message
Its a 4 digit code, each digit has its own
defination.
MTI also contains information about who originated the message (acquirer or issuer).
Example:
An acquirer requesting that the payment for a purchase be authorized by the issuer. Here Issuer responds that the payment has been authorized or declined.
⁃ Similarly, A message that was initiated by the issuer to reverse a payment (in case of a payment dispute)..
... cmd
First 4 digits: MIT - Message Information Type
digit - Version 1987 (0) 1993 (1) 2003 (2)
Nmt
digit
Type of Trans 1: Authorization, 2:ReAuth/Advice 4:Reversal/chargebacks
digit - 0:Request 1:Response 2:Repeat Request
digit - message sender (0/1-Acquirer or 2/3-issuer/issuer repeated)
""Bitmap: ""
Its not mandatory that every field should be present in
⁃ Receiving system has to parse the bitmap information in two parts
IS08583 message. So, Bitmap helps by indicating which data elements are actually present in message body
Primary bitmap
First 8 bytes of data into 64 bits. i.e., It can give presence of 64 Data elements.
Here each byte is 8 bits, so Primary bit map will have 64 bits
Each bit represents presence of that particular postion data element on/off (1/0).
⁃ Example: bit in position two is on (1) means DE2 is present, which is a PAN.
⁃ Bit at position one represents presence of Secondary bitmap. if position one is on then there are more data elements beyond 64
P zero (0) indicates the absence of a data element in the assigned position
Secondary Bitmap: if I5O message is having
anyone data element between 65 to 128 then secondary bitmap is mandatory
Here also same as
primary bitmap,
next


bytes represents secondary bitmap, each byte is 8 bits,
So, it will give presence of data elements between 65 to 125


""Data Elements:""
⁃ Data elements part of message contains actual data.
As
per original ISO 8583:1987 standard, there are up to 128 data elements specified
Later on versions it was extended to 192 data elements (As of now most of the systems are still using only 128)
All these data fields put together cover all the use cases
including payments, reversals, settlements, and even administrative activities.
Information about the card number (called primary account number), card expiry date, payment amount, Payment date and time,
conversion rate, message authentication code (a field that is relevant if the user was asked to enter
passed as data elements in I50 8583 and each data element has a defined position.
Each data field can either be of a fixed or variable length.
