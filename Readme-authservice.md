VirtuPay Authorization Service fulfills the need of approving on declining the credit using Virtual Cards (VCN)
Its similar to any other Card authrorization process, except an additional layer which only knows about VCN details.
In regular auth process, PAN will be directly authorized by

additional layer which will only have details about VCN.
