#### Defination of Data Extract Type's
All EBCDIC Fields are 'cp500" encoded, we need to decode when returning the data.

CHAR FIXED:

Fixed Length Charecter field, if length is 6 then read next 6 bytes LL CHAR:

-LLL EBC CHAR:

Variable Length Charecter field, first 2 bytes gives length of the data, find lenght and read next no of bytes length, Ex: first two bytes give 4 as lenght then read next 4 bytes for data

EBC CHR FIXED:

Variable Length Charecter field, first 3 bytes gives length of the data, find lenght and read next no of bytes length. Ex: first two bytes give 4 as lenght then read next 4 bytes for data, do "cp5ae" decoding.

-Fixed Length EBC field, if length is 6 then read next 6 bytes , do decoding with "cp500"

-Variable All Other:

LLL BINARY: Length binary field, first 3 bytes gives length of the data, find lenght and read next no of bytes length. Ex: first two bytes give 4 as lenght then read next 4 bytes for data, do 'cp500 decoding.

Fixed Length Binary field, if length is 6 then read next 6 bytes

MasterCard PDS Fields:

POS data is a schema with RDW (Record Desciptor Word)

Parse entire PDS data in a loop until all PDS fields in the data is finished.

First 4 chars are PDS Tag field

Next 3 chars represents length of value of the tag available next to it.

Extract next set of chars based on length above, which is a value.

Ex: PDS Data is: 0159002US

Tag is first 4 chars: '0159"

Value is of length int(002)-2

next 2 chars is value: us

POS data may contain multple tags, we just need to extract sameway in loop.
